I would follow a similar business plan to GoPro cameras where certain groups could share their photos and  
experiences to help create brand awareness and a cult following. The idea is that a special jpg file could  
have a QR border and special QR code overlayed on the jpg with pixels which a camera could detect but the  
human eye would not detect. Please give me some ideas the best 3 ways to implement this.</p>
