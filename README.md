# PopCork
## Popcork is a Social Media app companion which allows users users who are connected to <\br> a particular group, or event share memories, coordinate travel plans, tell stories, share experiences. 

I would follow a similar business plan to GoPro cameras where certain groups could share their photos and  
experiences to help create brand awareness and a cult following. The idea is that a special jpg file could  
have a QR border and special QR code overlayed on the jpg with pixels which a camera could detect but the  
human eye would not detect. Please give me some ideas the best 3 ways to implement this.</p>
